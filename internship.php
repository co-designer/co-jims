							As part of the University course curriculum, it is mandatory for the BBA students of the Second Year (Fourth Semester) to undergo Six weeks Summer Internship, during the period June/July.Internships and Live projects have also to be undergone by BCA & BJMC students.Internships are very important, because they substantially increase the chance of graduates finding employment. To an employer, a candidate who has spent time working for a firm within a particular industry shows dedication to a particular career, enthusiasm for a particular job and importantly, has experience.

Internships also allow interns to make contacts with managers and recruiters, which can later be used to negotiate full-time employment.
